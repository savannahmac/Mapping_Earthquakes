# Mapping Earthquake Data

The Disaster Reporting Network is a nonprofit dedicated to reporting the most accurate and understandable data regarding natural disasters. 
This goal of this project was to create an interactive map that displayed earthquake data from around the globe. 
Markers on the map represent the intensity of the earthquake. Visitors to the website can visualize where earthquakes most commonly occur. 
Adding tectonic plate data to the map also allows visitors to better understand the connection between fault lines and earthquakes. 

Visitors can switch between street, satellite, or dark mode. Additionally, they can turn features of the map on and off using the layers button in the top right corner of the screen.
This allows visitors to emphasize the specific pieces of data they are seeking, whether that be the location of tectonic plates or the most common area for major earthquakes.
